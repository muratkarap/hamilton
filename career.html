<h6 id="head2">KARTING</h6>
<p id="p2">Hamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships. Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: <span style="font-style: italic;"> "Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars."</span></p>
